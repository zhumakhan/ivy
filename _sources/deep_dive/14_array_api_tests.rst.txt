In conjunction with our own ivy unit tests, we import the array-api `test suite`_. These tests check that all
ivy backend libraries behave according to the `Array API Standard`_ which was established
in May 2020 by a group of maintainers. It was intended to bring some consistency and completeness to the various python
libraries that have gained popularity in the last 5-10 years. Since Ivy aims to unify machine learning frameworks,
it makes sense that we value consistency in behaviour across each of the backend libraries in our code too.

The test suite is included in the ivy repository as a submodule in the folder `test_array_api`_,
which we keep updated with the upstream test suite. The array-api tests repository is maintained by a group of developers
unconnected to Ivy. We have made the decision to import the test suite directly from this repository rather than having
our own fork. This means that the test suite you see in the ivy source code cannot be modified in the usual way of
pushing to the ivy master branch. Instead, the change must be made to the array-api repository directly and then our
submodule must be updated with the commands:

.. code-block:: none

        # to initialise local config file and fetch + checkout submodule (not needed everytime)
        git submodule update --init --recursive

        # pulls changes from upstream remote repo and merges them
        git submodule update --recursive --remote --merge

and only *then* can changes to the submodule be pushed to ivy-master, i.e. only when these changes exist in the
source array-api repository. See the `git website`_ for further information on working with submodules.

Running the tests
-----------------

The entire test suite is run independently `for each backend`_ on every push to the repo.
Therefore, every function which exists in the standard is thoroughly tested for
adherence to the standard on a continuous basis.

You will need to make sure the Array API tests are passing for each backend framework if/when making any changes to Ivy
functions which are part of the standard. If a test fails on the CI, you can see details about the failure under
`Details -> Run [backend] Tests`.

You can also run the tests locally before making a PR. There are two ways to do this: by the terminal or using your IDE.

Using the bash file (runs Docker)
****

Using the terminal, you can run all array-api tests for a certain backend using the bash file `test_array_api.sh`_:

.. code-block:: none

        # /ivy
        /bin/bash -e ./run_tests_CLI/test_array_api.sh  '<insert_chosen_backend>'

You can change the argument with any of our supported frameworks - tensorflow, numpy, torch or jax. If you rather
run a single test or test file with terminal, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: none

        # run all tests in a file
        pytest -vv ivy_tests/test_array_api/array_api_tests/test_manipulation_functions.py

        # run a single test
        pytest -vv ivy_tests/test_array_api/array_api_tests/test_manipulation_functions.py -k "test_array_method_signature"

Using the IDE
****
You can also run a specific test or test file by using your IDE. To make this work, you should set the
backend explicitly in the `_array_module.py` file. You can find it in the `array_api_tests` submodule. At the beginning
of the file, you will see the following line of code :code:`array_module = None`. You need to comment out that line and add
the following code:

.. code-block:: none

        import ivy as array_module
        array_module.set_backend("<insert_chosen_backend>")

After that, you can run the API test files as you typically would with other tests. See `here`_  for instructions on how
to run tests in ivy more generally. *NB*: make sure to not add any changes to the array-api files to your commit.

Test Skipping
-------------
Certain tests may need to be skipped when running the array-api test suite. This could be due to a variety of reasons:

#. the test function has a known issue which the `array-api test repository`_ developers are working on (e.g. :code:`test_asarray_arrays`)
#. the function itself deviates from the standard (e.g. :code:`test_floor_divide`)
#. there is an issue with the hypothesis test data generation i.e. a failed 'health check' (e.g. :code:`test_iop[__imod__(x1_i < 0 and x2_i is +0) -> NaN]`)
#. tolerance issues when asserting output :code:`isequal()` (e.g. :code:`test_matrix_norm`)

All the examples in this list except point 3 (which only occurs with tensorflow) refer to numpy functions, and the first
two are skipped in the `array-api test repository`_ also. The data generation and tolerance issues are not skipped in the
array-api repo and are difficult for Ivy developers
to solve as we cannot alter the tests directly. Currently, we import the test suite and run it; we do not
have our own fork that we can tweak at will. The rationale for doing so is that we should adhere as closely to the
standard as possible. These issues have been raised in the array-api test repo and will be addressed in due course.

There are currently two ways to skip array-api tests:

#. in :code:`ivy_tests/array_api_methods_to_test/<submodule>.txt` and
#. in :code:`ivy_tests/skips.txt`

The first method was implemented before the second. Each :code:`<submodule>.txt` file contains a comprehensive list
of functions which belong to that submodule, some of which are commented out. The commented-out functions are being
skipped *only* for the backend(s) that is/are causing the failure, not all the backends. The latter method, on the
other hand, skips a test on *all* backends, even if
it is just failing on one. The :code:`ivy_tests/skips.txt` scheme was implemented to skip *specific test cases*. The array-api
test suite contains a set of special tests which aim to cover edge-case input and particular data type promotion rules
(see :code:`ivy_tests/test_array_api/array_api_tests/test_special_cases.py`). In :code:`ivy_tests/skips.txt`, tests are
skipped by writing the filepath + conditions on the input of the test e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash

    ivy_tests/test_array_api/array_api_tests/test_special_cases.py::test_iop[__ipow__(x1_i is -infinity and x2_i > 0 and not (x2_i.is_integer() and x2_i % 2 == 1)) -> +infinity]

is skipping the in-place operations test on the :code:`pow`
instance method when x1 is -infinity and x2 is a positive, odd float. The result should be +infinity, however there is
an issue with the numpy instance method and an `issue`_ has been raised on the numpy repository. Tests are categorised
in :code:`ivy_tests/skips.txt` according to the backend they are failing on and the reason for the failure. This should
make unskipping temporarily failing tests straightforward once the issue has been resolved, especially if the skip instruction
itself contains the exact input conditions that are failing.

**Round Up**

This should have hopefully given you a good understanding of how the Array API test suite is used for testing Ivy.

If you're ever unsure of how best to proceed,
please feel free to engage with the `array api tests discussion`_,
or reach out on `discord`_ in the `array api tests channel`_!
